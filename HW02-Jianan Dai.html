                Let me start with the directer: Hayao Miyazaki.
        </p>
        <p>
                Hayao Miyazaki is a Japanese film director, producer, screenwriter, animator, author, and manga artist. A co-founder of Studio Ghibli, a film and animation studio, he has attained international acclaim as a masterful storyteller and as a maker of anime feature films, and is widely regarded as one of the greatest animation directors.

    I want to introduce some of my favorite animation movies.

        Despite what the title might lead you to believe, the main character in this film is male -- a rarity among Miyazaki protagonists. Young warrior prince Ashitaka is afflicted with a deadly curse. As he searches the forests of the west to find a cure that will save his life, Ashitaka finds himself in the middle of a battle between a group of rifle-toting ironworkers and the angry gods of the forest. Things get even more complicated when he meets the fiery Princess Mononoke, a young woman raised by wolves.
    </p>
    <p>
        Including Whisper of the Heart on this list is a bit of a stretch -- Miyazaki did not direct the film, but wrote it and was credited as storyboarder, producer, and sequence director.

        The story focuses on Shizuku Tsukishima, an insecure kid who loves reading books about fairytales. By chance she meets Seiji, a student in her class and fellow bookworm. Over time, Shizuku falls in love with Seiji, and his dream of becoming a violin craftsman inspires her to pursue her own dream of becoming a fantasy novelist.
